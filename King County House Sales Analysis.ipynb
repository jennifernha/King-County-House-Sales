    "## Overview\n",
    "This analysis project explores trends in film business to provide Microsoft with actionable recommendations as they want to enter this business as well. we will review data sets from TheNumbers.com and IMDb to determine when Microsoft should release a movie, which types of genres to consider, and whom to recruit. The methodology includes filtering, and joining and visualizing data sets to show different trends in ROI. The result shows higher ROI when Mystery, Horror, and Animation movies are released in May-July, and November-December. I recommend Microsoft to partner with lists of top 10 actors and directors in those genres, and release movies during the summer (May-July) or holiday season (Nov-Dec)."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "This analysis leads to three recommendations for creating movies :\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Release movies in May, June, July, November, or December.** Our analysis shows that summertime and holiday seasons are the best time of year to release a movie. If Microsoft wants to release a movie across the world simultaneously, I recommend launching a movie in June or July. If different timeline can be applied, release a movie in the States in May first, then internationally in June.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Produce a movie in Mystery, Horror, Animation genres.** Microsoft has the capability to run movie business in many countries as it has many locations worldwide. Therefore, I recommend producing a movie in Mystery, Horror, and Animation to target audience globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Recruit people with proven stats.** I provided lists of top 10 actors and directors in top 3 genres that generated the most profit. Microsoft should contact these individuals and try to recruit them to enter this competitive movie industry"

    "Further analyses could lead to additional insights:\n",
    "* **ROI Trend in Popular Genres**: while we have identified which top 3 genres have generated the most profit, such analysis can provide whether the business is continuously growing in those genres over time.\n",
    "* **Ideal Budget Range**: This modeling could predict the ideal production budget for the movies that Microsoft wants to produce."
